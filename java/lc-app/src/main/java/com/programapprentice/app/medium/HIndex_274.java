     [274] H-Index

     https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index

     Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute
     the researcher's h-index.

     According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have
     at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

     For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them
     had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
     Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more
     than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

     Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

        if (citations.length == 1) {
            if (citations[0] == 0) {

            } else {
                return 1;
