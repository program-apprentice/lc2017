     Nearly every one have used the Multiplication Table. But could you
     find out the k-th smallest number quickly from the multiplication table?

     Given the height m and the length n of a m * n Multiplication Table,
     and a positive integer k, you need to return the k-th smallest number in this table.

     Example 1:
     Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
     Output:
     Explanation:
     The Multiplication Table:
     1	2	3
     2	4	6
     3	6	9

     The 5-th smallest number is 3 (1, 2, 2, 3, 3).
     Example 2:
     Input: m = 2, n = 3, k = 6
     Output:
     Explanation:
     The Multiplication Table:
     1	2	3
     2	4	6

     The 6-th smallest number is 6 (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6).
     Note:
     The m and n will be in the range [1, 30000].
     The k will be in the range [1, m * n]
